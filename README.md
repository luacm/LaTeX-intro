## Introduction

LaTeX (pronounced la-tech) is a more powerful and professional way to create documents then traditional word processors like Microsoft word. Similar to programming, LaTeX involves writing code which then compiles into a pdf document. Hopefully, this short introduction will give you the tools and mindset to understand and utilize LaTeX effectively.

## The LaTeX Way

Before we begin it is important to note that LaTeX is __not__ a word processor and is not a one-for-one substitution for one. Emails are more effectively written in a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor than with LaTeX. That said, for resumes, mathematic-based homework, and papers LaTeX is superior choice. 

LaTeX is for documents where you care a great deal about the control have over them.
